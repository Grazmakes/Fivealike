# Netlify Deployment Instructions for Five Alike

## Important: Use the NEW Package

Deploy **`five-alike-final-netlify.zip`** (NOT the old package) to fix the "Page not found" error.

## Step-by-Step Deployment

1. **Delete your current Netlify site** if it exists (to start fresh)

2. **Deploy the new package:**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Drag and drop `five-alike-final-netlify.zip` to create new site
   - OR use "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"

3. **Add Environment Variables:**
   - Go to Site settings → Environment variables
   - Import from `.env.production` file (included in package)
   - OR add manually:
     ```
     TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
     GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=your_google_books_api_key_here
     RAWG_API_KEY=your_rawg_api_key_here
     DEEZER_API_KEY=your_deezer_api_key_here
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
     ITUNES_API_KEY=your_itunes_api_key_here
     LASTFM_API_KEY=your_lastfm_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Trigger deploy:**
   - Go to Deploys tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

## What Was Fixed

- ✅ Removed `trailingSlash: true` that caused routing issues
- ✅ Simplified `_redirects` file for App Router compatibility
- ✅ Optimized `netlify.toml` configuration
- ✅ All API routes working as λ (serverless functions)
- ✅ Environment variables template included

## Verification

After deployment:
1. Site should load without "Page not found" error
2. Search functionality should work with live APIs
3. Items should show real data instead of mock data

If you still see issues, ensure you're using the **NEW** package: `five-alike-final-netlify.zip`
