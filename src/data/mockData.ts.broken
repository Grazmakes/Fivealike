    description: 'If Inception left you questioning what\'s real and what\'s a dream, these films will blow your mind even further! The Matrix revolutionized sci-fi with its "reality is a simulation" concept, Blade Runner 2049 creates a visually stunning dystopia that questions what makes us human, Memento tells its story backwards to put you in the mind of someone with memory loss, Interstellar combines hard science with emotional depth across space and time, and The Prestige weaves a tale of obsession and illusion that will have you rewatching to catch every twist. Each one will leave you discussing theories long after the credits roll.',

Better Call Saul is literally the perfect prequel showing how Jimmy McGill becomes Saul Goodman, The Wire presents the most realistic portrayal of urban crime and politics ever filmed, Ozark puts a family in impossible situations where every choice leads deeper into darkness, Narcos chronicles the rise and fall of real drug cartels with incredible attention to detail, and Fargo blends dark comedy with shocking violence in anthology seasons that will keep you guessing. Each show excels at making you root for morally complex characters you probably shouldn\'t.',
